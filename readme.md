# Machine Learning Project - Titanic

## Description

This project is focused on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on various features. The analysis is performed using the `main.py` and `data_manipulation.py` scripts, along with the data provided in the `train.csv` file.

The `main.py` script serves as the entry point for the project. It orchestrates the data manipulation and analysis tasks by calling functions defined in the `data_manipulation.py` module. The `data_manipulation.py` module contains functions for preprocessing and transforming the dataset.

The `train.csv` file contains the training data for the project. It includes information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. This data is used to train machine learning models and make predictions about the survival of passengers.

The Titanic dataset used in this project was taken from a Kaggle competition. You can find more information about the competition and the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).
